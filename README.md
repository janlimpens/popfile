# popfile

POPFile is an automatic mail classification tool. Once properly set up and trained, it will scan all email as it arrives and classify it based on your training. You can give it a simple job, like separating out junk e-mail, or a complicated one-like filing mail into a dozen folders. Think of it as a personal assistant for your inbox.

This GPL licensed project has not seen any updates since 2011. There still is the website https://getpopfile.org, but cecame stale years ago. Links don't work anymore, etc...

Firstly this is to keep the souces available, so someone would want them. Secondly I am thinking about maintaining the project, slimming it down and developping it further.

I am a user of popfile for ages and it serves me well until today. It became a bit oldfashioned, but I still haven't found anything that fits my needs as good.
