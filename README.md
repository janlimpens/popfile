# popfile

POPFile is an automatic mail classification tool. Once properly set up and
trained, it will scan all email as it arrives and classify it based on your
training. You can give it a simple job, like separating out junk e-mail, or a
complicated one like filing mail into a dozen folders. Think of it as a personal
assistant for your inbox.

This GPL-licensed project has not seen any updates since 2011. There still is
the website https://getpopfile.org, but it became stale years ago. Links don't
work anymore, etc.

Firstly, this is to keep the sources available. Secondly, I am thinking about
maintaining the project, slimming it down, and developing it further. Let me
know (star it, create an issue to say hi, etc), if you are interested!

I have been a user of POPFile for ages, and it serves me well until today. It
became a bit old-fashioned, but I still haven't found anything that fits my
needs as well.

There are currently two branchen, *maintainance*, where I fix bugs and *main*, the
devlopment branch. So you probably use the former.
